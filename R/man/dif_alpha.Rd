Creating Tolerance interval for a vector of alpha values
}
\description{
Create a tolerance interval for difference delta values
}
\usage{
dif_alpha(data = data, alpha = seq(0.01,0.05, by = 0.01), delta = 0.05,...)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{
  data to be used
}
 \item{cows}{
  the amount of cows in the dataset
}
  \item{amount}{
  the amount of milkings per cow
}
  \item{alpha}{
  the alpha value to be used for Tolerance, Confidence or Prediction upper bounds
}
  \item{delta}{
  the delta value to be used for the two different types of Tolerance intervals
}
  \item{mrl}{
  Maximum Residue Limit allowed within the milk of each cow
  }
  \item{y_variable}{
  column number for the y_variable to be used in calculating the TTSC
  }
  \item{time_variable}{
  column number referencing the variable that shows the time at which each milking occured
  }
}
\details{
This function will calculate the mrl for all values given in the vector for the parameter alpha. It will then provide you with the amount of cows that would be said to be safe to milk at different milking times. If there are any cows that do have a different safe milking time then it will stop, if not it will just give the TTSC for the first alpha value.

Using pre installed dataset pred_table:
dif_alpha(data = pred_table, cows = 25, amount = 8, alpha = c(0.05,0.1), delta = 0.05, y_variable = 6, time_variable = 3, mrl = log(0.04))
