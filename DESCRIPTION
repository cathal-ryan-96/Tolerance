Description: Create TTSC using Tolerance intervals to check when a certain antibiotic or medicine given to cows. This allows us to know when the milk from these cows is safe for human consumption.
    It can also provide Tolerance upper bounds using Natrellas method. It also provides user ability to select confidence or prediction upper bounds aswell.
    It also allows for the use of a vector of values for both delta (which is used only for tolerance bounds) and alpha (which is used for confidence and prediction bounds aswell as the tolerance bounds).
